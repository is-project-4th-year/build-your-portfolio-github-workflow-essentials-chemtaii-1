## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

### a. GitHub Pages

**Expectation**: I thought GitHub Pages was only for hosting static portfolio sites with complex setup steps I wouldn’t understand.
**Reality**: It was actually simple! Just pushed my project to a specific branch, enabled GitHub Pages, and my site was live.
**Impact**: I hosted my portfolio project publicly and shared it with peers and mentors without needing a paid domain or server.


### b. Pull Requests

**Expectation**: I assumed pull requests were only for big teams reviewing each other’s code—irrelevant for solo projects.
**Reality**: Even in my own projects, they helped me review changes carefully before merging, which avoided a lot of bugs.
**Impact**: I used pull requests to merge features into my main branch—like my contact form—after confirming they worked properly.


### c. Merge Conflicts

**Expectation**: I honestly thought I’d avoid merge conflicts completely—they sounded like a nightmare only advanced developers face.
**Reality**: I ran into one on day two! But resolving it wasn’t so bad with VS Code—it even taught me how different parts of my project connected.
**Impact**: I got more confident with debugging and learned to read my code more closely before pushing.


### d. Commit Messages

**Expectation**: I thought commit messages didn’t matter much—just something to type quickly like “done” or “update”.
**Reality**: Meaningful commit messages helped me track my progress and understand what I changed, especially when I looked back days later.
**Impact**: I started writing useful messages like `Add documentation for Daisy` or `Updated profile section for Daisy`, which made navigating my repo way easier.
