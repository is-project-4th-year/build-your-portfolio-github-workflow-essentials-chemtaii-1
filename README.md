# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Project Assignment

Welcome to your **Personal Portfolio Project**! This assignment is designed to help you practice core GitHub and project management skills, including milestones, issues, project boards, branching, commit conventions, pull requests, and resolving merge conflicts.

---

## 📌 Project Management Guidelines

### ✅ Milestones
Define major phases or deliverables of your portfolio (e.g., Landing Page, Team Profiles, Admin Panel).

### ✅ Issues
Break each milestone into manageable tasks. Link these issues to their related milestone for better tracking.

### ✅ Project Board
Create a GitHub project board with columns like:
- `To Do`
- `In Progress`
- `Done`

Assign tasks and pull requests to the appropriate columns.

---

## 🔧 Git Workflow

### 🔀 Branching
Use feature branches for each issue. Adopt a consistent naming format such as:

```
feature/<issue-number>-short-description
```

### 💬 Commits
Use structured, meaningful commit messages:

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <short description>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Commit Types: `(use at least 6 of these)`**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Formatting, white space, etc.
- `refactor`: Code restructure (no feature or bug)
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Test-related updates
- `chore`: Non-code updates (e.g., config)
- `build`: Build system or dependency changes
- `ci`: Continuous integration changes

**Example:**
```
feat(portfolio): add responsive navigation bar

Added a mobile-first responsive nav using Flexbox.

Closes #45
```

---

## 🔄 Pull Requests & Merge Conflicts

- Open a PR for each feature branch.
- Link the PR to its corresponding issue.
- Request reviews before merging.
- Document any merge conflict resolution in the PR or commit message.

---

## 🚀 Deployment & Documentation

- Keep the `main` branch always deployable.
- Deploy using GitHub Pages (mandatory) and any suitable platform (optional).
- Complete the `Assignment.md` file in this repository by addressing all listed requirements. This document will be used for evaluation.
